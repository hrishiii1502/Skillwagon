## **LMS Backend Completion Roadmap (21 Days)**

### **Week 1: Core User and Instructor APIs**
#### **Day 1:**
- Set up the `Instructor` model.
- Define validation schema for instructor registration and login.
- Create APIs for instructor registration and login.
- Write middleware for instructor role validation.

#### **Day 2:**
- Work on `Course` model:
  - Add fields for course details (title, description, instructor, price, etc.).
  - Define relationships with users and instructors.
- Write validation schema for creating and updating courses.

#### **Day 3:**
- Create APIs for instructors to:
  - Add a course.
  - Update their course details.
  - Delete their course.
- Add authentication and role-based access control for these APIs.

#### **Day 4:**
- Implement APIs for listing all courses:
  - Public API for students to view courses.
  - Authenticated API for instructors to see their own courses.
- Add pagination and filtering (e.g., by category, price).

#### **Day 5:**
- Set up the `Quiz` model:
  - Include fields for questions, answers, and associated courses.
- Create APIs for instructors to:
  - Add quizzes to their courses.
  - Update quiz questions.
  - Delete quizzes.

#### **Day 6:**
- Write APIs for students to:
  - Enroll in a course.
  - Fetch their enrolled courses.
  - Attempt quizzes and submit answers.
- Ensure validations for prerequisites (e.g., student must be enrolled to attempt quizzes).

#### **Day 7:**
- Test all APIs created so far:
  - Validate request/response cycles.
  - Handle edge cases and errors.
- Fix bugs and refine code.

---

### **Week 2: Advanced Features**
#### **Day 8:**
- Implement the `Forum` model for course discussions:
  - Include fields for posts, comments, and associated users/courses.
- Write APIs for:
  - Creating posts in a course forum (students and instructors).
  - Commenting on posts.
  - Fetching all posts and comments in a forum.

#### **Day 9:**
- Work on `Payment Integration`:
  - Set up a payment gateway (e.g., Stripe, Razorpay).
  - Create APIs for handling course purchases.
  - Ensure payment validation and transaction tracking.

#### **Day 10:**
- Implement APIs for generating course certificates:
  - Generate a certificate after course completion.
  - Store certificates in the database.
  - Allow students to download their certificates.

#### **Day 11:**
- Build the `Rating and Review` system:
  - Write APIs for students to rate and review courses.
  - Calculate average ratings dynamically.
  - Allow instructors to view course ratings and feedback.

#### **Day 12:**
- Implement role-based dashboards:
  - Student dashboard (enrolled courses, progress, certificates).
  - Instructor dashboard (created courses, student enrollments, course feedback).
  - Admin dashboard (manage users, instructors, courses).

#### **Day 13:**
- Write admin APIs for:
  - Viewing all users, instructors, and courses.
  - Deleting inappropriate courses or users.
  - Promoting/demoting roles (e.g., instructor to admin).

#### **Day 14:**
- Test and refine all advanced feature APIs.
- Focus on performance optimization (e.g., caching, query optimization).

---

### **Week 3: Finalization and Deployment**
#### **Day 15-16:**
- Set up the `Notification` system:
  - Include fields for user-specific notifications (e.g., enrollment confirmations, course updates).
  - Write APIs to send and fetch notifications.

#### **Day 17:**
- Implement user activity tracking (optional):
  - Log API usage and user actions (e.g., quiz attempts, course completions).
  - Use MongoDB aggregation for reporting.

#### **Day 18:**
- Write API documentation (e.g., using Swagger or Postman).
- Ensure proper error handling and standard HTTP responses.

#### **Day 19-20:**
- Test the entire backend thoroughly:
  - Simulate real-world scenarios.
  - Fix remaining bugs.
  - Ensure security best practices (e.g., input validation, token expiration).

#### **Day 21:**
- Deploy the backend:
  - Set up the server (e.g., AWS, Heroku, or Render).
  - Configure the database for production.
  - Test APIs post-deployment.
- Finalize and prepare for frontend integration.

---

### **Notes:**
- Focus on one model/API at a time to avoid confusion.
- Maintain proper folder structure (e.g., controllers, routes, models).
- Keep code modular and reusable.
- Regularly test your APIs using tools like Postman or Thunder Client.
